### Bias Any Stretch of the Imagination ### 

## Simple sampling with dplyr ##

# View the whole population dataset
View(spotify_population)

# Sample 1000 rows from spotify_population
spotify_sample <-  spotify_population %>% 
slice_sample(n = 1000)


# See the result
spotify_sample

# Calculate the mean duration in mins from spotify_population
mean_dur_pop <- spotify_population %>% 
  summarize(mean_dur = mean(duration_minutes))

# Calculate the mean duration in mins from spotify_sample
mean_dur_samp <- spotify_sample %>% 
  summarize(mean_dur = mean(duration_minutes))

# See the results
mean_dur_pop
mean_dur_samp

## Simple sampling with base-R ## 

# Get the loudness column of spotify_population
loudness_pop <- spotify_population$loudness

# Sample 100 values of loudness_pop
loudness_samp <- sample(loudness_pop, size = 100)

# See the results
loudness_samp

# Calculate the standard deviation of loudness_pop
sd_loudness_pop <- sd(loudness_pop)

# Calculate the standard deviation of loudness_samp
sd_loudness_samp <- sd(loudness_samp)

# See the results
sd_loudness_pop
sd_loudness_samp

### A little too convenient ###

## Are findings from the sample generalizable? ##

# Visualize the distribution of acousticness as a histogram with a binwidth of 0.01
ggplot(spotify_population, aes(acousticness))+
geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)

# Update the histogram to use spotify_mysterious_sample with x-axis limits from 0 to 1
ggplot(spotify_mysterious_sample, aes(acousticness)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)+ 
  xlim(c(0, 1))
  
 ## Are the findings generalizable? 2 ## 
 
# Visualize the distribution of duration_minutes as a histogram with a binwidth of 0.5
ggplot(spotify_population,
    aes(duration_minutes))+
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, colour = "green") 
    
# Update the histogram to use spotify_mysterious_sample2 with x-axis limits from 0 to 15
ggplot(spotify_mysterious_sample2, aes(duration_minutes)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)+ 
  xlim(c(0, 15))    
  
### What does random mean? ###

## Generating random numbers ## 

# Generate random numbers from ...
randoms <- data.frame(
  # a uniform distribution from -3 to 3
  uniform = runif(5000, min = -3, max = 3),
  # a normal distribution with mean 5 and sd 2
  normal = rnorm(5000, mean = 5, sd = 2)
)

# Plot a histogram of uniform values, binwidth 0.25
ggplot(randoms, aes(uniform))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25, color = "green")
  
# Plot a histogram of normal values, binwidth 0.5
ggplot(randoms, aes(normal))+ 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5)
